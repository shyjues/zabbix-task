According to me for these tasks which has built in modules in ansible its 
always advisable to use ansible playbooks. If we do need to something not available 
then we can easily extend the tasks and use Python. 

From my experience any custom code would require more effort and there would
be definitely scenarios which would be missed. These would create more issues. 
Ansible is a framework which would fill this gap and help us save effort for
all config management.
